This inventory reports GitHub state; issue closure does not prove that an entire product requirement is complete. Build observations cover the latest 100 runs, retaining the latest relevant run per workflow and branch. Active builds report job progress and failures from the same observation; completed failures are inspected once per changed attempt. This automation never retries a build or publishes a release.
