# Anonymous product telemetry — V08

**Planned scope, recorded 23 October 2026.** This is a future implementation and
acceptance contract. It adds V08 to the [66-requirement inventory](../PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md)
and is queued after the current live-update/independent-host milestone. It is
not shipping and is not included in frozen 4.46.1. No collector, telemetry
setting, product code or release is changed by recording this request.

The user's request, verbatim:

> - Full telemetry
> - Anonymous
> - Users can opt in or out (opt in by default)
> - It’s just so we can get data from the app and get usage and things like that.

“Opt in by default” means enabled by default with clear disclosure and an easy,
persistent opt-out and re-enable control. “Full” means coverage of product
workflows through bounded aggregate measurements; it does not authorize
collecting user content or identifying people, organizations or devices.

## Measurement and anonymity contract

Maintain a versioned, reviewed catalog covering desktop, browser, native-agent
and headless workflows: setup, connections, retrieval, capture, models, backup,
updates and host controls. Instrument fixed workflow boundaries without reading
their content for telemetry. Each supported workflow must have an explicit
measurement or a documented exclusion, also visible in the local payload preview.

| Include as bounded aggregates | Exclude from collection, queue, transport and collector logs |
| --- | --- |
| Feature use, completion/failure counts and sampled latency histograms | Memory/chat/prompt contents, responses, snippets, embeddings, transcripts and screenshots |
| Coarse CPU/process-RAM, configured resource-budget and pressure buckets | Exact hardware inventory, serials, installed software/fonts or other fingerprints |
| Coarse transmitted/received byte counts, throughput and queue/drop buckets | File/directory paths, filenames, URLs, hosts, addresses, custom labels and arbitrary metadata |
| Fixed public error-code categories such as `network_timeout` or `readiness_timeout` | Exception text, stacks, crash dumps, credentials, tokens, keys or private diagnostics |
| Coarse platform, architecture, release-family and resource cohorts | Account, organization, workspace, memory, operation, session, device or advertising IDs; hashes/pseudonyms of these values |

Strings must come from fixed enums; numeric values need explicit ranges,
clipping and buckets. Unknown fields, nested arbitrary objects and free text are
rejected at both producer and collector. Resource/bandwidth figures identify
their unit and sampling basis; unavailable sensors remain unknown, not zero.
Do not infer physical memory bandwidth from request throughput.

Use coarse reporting windows, discard event ordering and exact timestamps, and
allow only reviewed combinations of cohort dimensions. Send platform/version
and resource views without join keys or a persistent per-installation profile.
Avoid combining rare versions, hardware buckets and error patterns into a
fingerprint. No cookies, session replay, stable random IDs, hashed account/device
IDs or cross-session linking. Pseudonymous tracking must never be described as
anonymous. Reports measure sampled usage, not unique people/devices, retention
or individual journeys that would require such linking.

## Disclosure, user choice and company policy

Before the first possible emission, show what is measured, the destination and
purpose, the default-enabled state, limits and **Disable product telemetry**.
The same setting and payload/schema preview must be available before workspace
sign-in and during an outage, and discoverable later in app settings. Initial
headless/native-agent setup must disclose the same default and expose structured
setup, status, disable and re-enable operations; silence is not a completed
setup disclosure.

Persist the explicit choice across process/app restart and supported updates.
An unreadable or invalid preference/policy suppresses emission until repaired.
Opt-out stops new collection and emission, cancels queued sends/retries, and
clears all pending aggregates from memory and disk. Check effective policy again
at the last send boundary, including work queued by another local process.
No final opt-out event or shutdown flush may escape the disabled policy. Already
transmitted bytes cannot be recalled; do not promise individual deletion from
anonymous aggregates that contain no lookup identity. Re-enable starts a fresh
queue and never resurrects discarded history.

Company policy may disable or narrow collection and takes precedence when more
restrictive. It must not force transmission over an explicit user opt-out.
Status distinguishes the saved preference, effective state, policy reason,
schema version and bounded queue/budget status without exporting company or
user identity. Desktop, background helpers and local agents share this effective
policy; headless installations need equivalent persistent controls. No telemetry
choice may affect memory features, permissions, pricing or support access.

Browser policy must persist across normal reloads and updates, honor applicable
browser privacy signals such as Global Privacy Control as an opt-out, and send
without credentials, cookies or referrers. Document storage-clearing/private-mode
limits; do not recreate a forgotten identifier or use fingerprinting to recover
a preference. Require fresh visible disclosure before any new default-enabled
state can emit after its preference store has genuinely been removed.

Optional product telemetry is separate from the private, permission-scoped
[workspace operational metrics](observability-and-evaluations.md) and security
audit trail. Disabling it does not disable necessary local access/recovery audit
records; those records must never be forwarded as a telemetry fallback.

## Proposed schema and payload preview

This illustrative payload is a design example, not an implemented endpoint or
an accepted release receipt. All strings shown are catalog enums. Each batch
uses one fixed feature/surface and one approved coarse cohort view; arbitrary
combinations, exact timestamps and identity fields are forbidden.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "window": "week",
  "surface": "desktop",
  "feature": "workspace.open",
  "cohort": {"platform": "windows", "version_family": "4.x"},
  "measurements": [
    {"metric": "completions", "bucket": "success", "count_bucket": "10-99"},
    {"metric": "latency_ms", "bucket": "100-499", "count_bucket": "10-99"},
    {"metric": "errors", "bucket": "network_timeout", "count_bucket": "1-9"}
  ]
}
```

Resource and bandwidth views use separately reviewed enums/buckets rather than
adding an exact machine profile to this envelope. Counts and charts must explain
sampling, clipping, bucket ranges and dropped reports. The local preview must
make the exact serialized outbound body and schema available before enabling or
sending, and disclose transport metadata separately; a clean JSON body alone is not
evidence that the whole path is anonymous.

## Collector and release conditions

The network terminator necessarily observes a source IP transiently to handle a
connection. The reviewed collection path must neither retain nor forward it,
including in access/error logs, CDN/WAF logs, tracing, crash diagnostics or
`Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-For` headers. Strip identifying origin, referrer,
user-agent and request/correlation metadata before aggregate processing; no
workspace authentication or credential forwarding is permitted. Verify this
through the actual ingress, proxies, collector and any monitoring/backup layer.
An infrastructure provider that retains identifying request logs fails this
contract; do not silently weaken the anonymity claim.

Process bounded contributions into coarse aggregate cells; do not retain raw
request bodies or a per-client event store. Keep only the volatile aggregation
state needed for the current window, and discard insufficient cells when it
closes. Set an explicit bounded aggregate retention period before launch.
Reporting must suppress small cohorts, rare cells, complementary cells and
filter/difference queries that could reveal a suppressed value. The architecture
review must specify and justify the minimum cohort threshold, contribution
bounds, and any required noise/privacy budget or secure aggregation. Report
counts are not distinct-user counts and cannot alone prove a cohort's anonymity.
Until those parameters and their attack tests pass, no collector launch or
analytics output is qualified.

A documented architecture/privacy review must substantiate anonymity against
payload linkage, transport metadata, rare cohorts and auxiliary information
before default-enabled collection can ship. If the proposed design requires
stable pseudonyms or identifying logs, it does not satisfy V08. Use existing
free infrastructure and tooling; no paid analytics, subscriptions, model calls
or new spending is authorized by this scope.

## Initial resource and reliability ceilings

These are acceptance ceilings for the future implementation, to be measured
with memory work active. A proposed increase requires a documented design
revision and new measurements; saturation must drop telemetry rather than
delay canonical memory work.

| Resource | Initial ceiling and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Local pending queue | At most 256 KiB or 512 aggregate records, whichever is reached first; maximum age 48 hours; bounded eviction and full opt-out clearing |
| Added resident working memory | At most 2 MiB per participating process; no model loading or new persistent service solely for telemetry |
| CPU | At most 0.5% of one core averaged over the representative workload; bounded producer work and no synchronous telemetry network calls in memory operations |
| Batch | At most 16 KiB encoded and 64 KiB decoded; one in flight, at most hourly, with randomized timing and sampling of frequent events |
| Network | At most 256 KiB outbound wire bytes per installation per rolling day, including retries/transport overhead; reserve a safe upper bound before connecting and pause when exhausted |
| Failure/offline behavior | Five-second attempt deadline; backoff starts at one hour and is capped at 24 hours with jitter; no forced connectivity, wake or shutdown flush; pause on constrained/metered policy |

Workers on the same installation share the local traffic budget without sending
its coordination identity. Offline and suspended operation remain useful; queued
events can expire or be sampled away. Telemetry failure never interrupts memory
writes, retrieval, capture, backup, updates or recovery. Measure enabled/disabled
overhead and tail latency under pressure; a budget violation blocks release.

## Required acceptance evidence

Implement meaningful outbound and privacy tests, rather than checking only that
a serializer matches its own example:

1. Exercise real app and agent workflows against a capture endpoint. Seed unique
   sentinel contents, labels, credentials, paths, URLs and IDs; inspect serialized
   bodies, headers, URLs, local queues and collector/ingress logs. None may escape,
   including through rejected inputs, encoding, exception or crash paths.
2. Observe fresh default disclosure, explicit disable/re-enable, persistent
   choices across restart/update, unreadable settings, company-disable precedence
   and a user opt-out that company policy cannot override. Confirm identical
   app/native-agent effective status without changing memory permissions.
3. Disable while offline, during batching, during a queued retry and during an
   in-flight request. Verify pending disk/memory state is cleared and no new
   emission starts after disable completes; reconnection/re-enable cannot replay
   the old queue. Account honestly for bytes already transmitted.
4. Saturate the queue and daily budget; simulate DNS/TLS failures, timeouts,
   collector rejection, suspension and metered policy while normal memory work
   continues. Measure RAM, CPU, wire bytes and tail latency, bounded eviction,
   retry spacing and the absence of shutdown or reconnect bursts.
5. Probe collector privacy through the actual deployment configuration, including
   proxies/CDN/WAF, monitoring and backups. Trigger success and error paths with
   recognizable test metadata and verify no identifying retention or forwarding.
   Inspect aggregate storage for hidden join keys or raw-request retention.
6. Test rare/coincident cohorts, repeated contributions and difference queries
   against the reviewed suppression/privacy mechanism. Verify output cannot
   reveal a withheld cell or be misrepresented as distinct-user statistics.

| Acceptance target | Required policy journey |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x64 | Installed app, native agent and headless preference/queue persistence; restart/update, offline and outbound proof |
| Linux ARM64 | Same actual installed journey and measured resource limits |
| Windows x64 | Installed app/background helper and native-agent parity; restart/update, policy permissions and queue clearing |
| Windows ARM64 | Same journey on the supported desktop/engine architecture; record emulation and measured limits |
| macOS x64 | Installed app/background helper and native-agent parity; restart/update, offline and outbound proof |
| macOS ARM64 | Same actual installed journey and measured resource limits |
| Web | Actual supported browser flows, disclosure, reload persistence, privacy signals, company policy, storage loss and credential/referrer-free transmission through the reviewed ingress |

Do not infer one target's policy or privacy pass from another. The final evidence
must include the reviewed catalog/schema, local payload preview, collector/log
configuration, anonymization analysis, bounded-load measurements, all native/web
receipts and public documentation. V08 remains **Planned** until implementation
and the appropriate later release acceptance establish the requested behavior;
this document alone changes no existing requirement's state.
